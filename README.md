# Street Workout Official Summer Drop Analysis

## Project Background
Calisthenics is a brand of strength training done with one's own bodyweight. Street Workout Official (SWO), as an e-commerce company, caters to calisthenics practitioners and professional athletes worldwide by selling sports apparel through its website and sponsoring various competitions. It was established in 2023. 

The company's growth in the past year has allowed there to be enough transactional data to fully implement a data analytics initiative. International Strength Nights (ISN) is posed to be their biggest competition yet presenting an opportunity to leverage its potential success by introducing more people to the brand and making sales. This project aims to analyse the transactions done after their summer release to understand customer preferences and optimise sales.

Insights and recommendations will be provided on the following areas:
- **Monthly Sales**: an evaluation of patterns in monthly sales and order frequency from January to June in comparison to last year.
- **Product Performance**: an analysis of the different products released during the summer drop with a focus on the average order value (AOV), quantity per order, and product combinations. This will be split between new customers and repeat customers. Repeat customers is defined as customers who purchased SWO products before and after the summer release.
